                  Who wants to become a web developer. For those who want to
                  learn web development from scratch and then get a job in a

                  much about programming or web development. Even those who have
                  studied CSE for four years and could not decide what to do,

                  We have created a secret Facebook group for the course. Where
                  I will be, we will have 14 professional web developers, we
                  have a few other team members to guide and support you in
                  other tasks. Our target is to answer all your questions within
                  24 hours. Most of the times instant reply is given. All
                  replies will be received within 6-8 hours on average.
                  Moreover, if you can't solve the problem inside the code by
                  writing (except Friday), there will be a few parallel meet
                  sessions at three times every day. Where you can solve your
                  problem by screen sharing. If you don't understand something
                  well, it will be explained. What else does it take? ðŸ˜‰
